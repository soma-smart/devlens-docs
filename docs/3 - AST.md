# Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)



Thanks to ANTLR4 parsers, we have created an AST that give you enough informations to find which node hold the information you want.

![AST](/../static/img/ast.png?raw=true "AST")

For example, this block represent the tree of a Python import."Import_Stmt" is the first node that interest us to filter every import in code. Then value of the import is located under the "Dotted_name" node.

To see the AST generated by the analyze of the project you simply have to use verbose mode on the command and choose if you want to store the tree somewhere:

```bash
./devlens -v checkf /src
```
or if you want to store the tree

```bash 
./devlens -v checkf /src > file.txt
```

This will give a general view of every node of your project, sorted by file.

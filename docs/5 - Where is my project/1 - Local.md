**Devlens** give you a way to analyze project locally just by the path of the folder or file you want to analyze.

Just follow the steps in the `interactive mode`:

![local](/../static/img/whereismyproject/local.png?raw=true "local")


Or you can also use the `classic mode`:

```bash
./devlens check downloads/
```

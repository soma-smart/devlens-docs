**Devlens** gives you a way to analyze a project locally just by the path of the folder or file you want to analyze.

## Interactive Mode

Just follow the steps in the `interactive mode`:

![local](/../static/img/whereismyproject/local.png?raw=true "local")

## Command Mode

Or you can also use the `command mode`:

```bash
./devlens check downloads/
```

One of the most powerful thing **Devlens** can do is to replace every values you want in a whole project just by using a single command.



Imagine you want to replace every SQL 'Select *' query of your project by more precise column like`name`:
![before](/../static/img/replace/before.png?raw=true "before")

Just by using the `interactive mode` you can specify the annotator that will "catch" the value and choose the replacement value:


![replace](/../static/img/replace/replace.png?raw=true "replace")



You can instantly see the change right after:

![after](/../static/img/replace/after.png?raw=true "after")

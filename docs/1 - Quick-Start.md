# Quick-start 


## Introduction


The search engine that help you find code pattern.

**Devlens** is a tool that scan your code to retreive pattern, and store their value and location in a Database. 

**DevLens** can help you write query like the following ones :

 - List the most used datasets in all your projects regardless of the technology used
 - Assess the quality of your code (code coverage, code smells, duplication, dead code, bad practices, complexity, etc.)
 - Search for specific code patterns (for example, search for all the code that uses a deprecated function)

It can be used manually via the terminal interface to get interactive feedback or as a service (for example to be integrated in a CI/CD pipeline).

For more example, see [Example page](/docs/2-%20Example.md).



## 4 easy steps to search what you want

**Devlens** will do all the work for you. You just have to tell it what to look for and it will get every occurence of the pattern. 


**-Step 1:** Tell him what you want ([If you want to know how to write Annotator](/docs/3%20-%20How%20it%20works/Annotation.md))

![analyze](/../static/img/intro/import-annotator.png?raw=true "analyze")

**- Step 2:** Launch the analyze([Locally](/docs/5%20-%20Where%20is%20my%20project/1%20-%20Local.md) or on [Dataiku](/docs/5%20-%20Where%20is%20my%20project/2%20-%20Dataiku.md)).

![analyze](/../static/img/intro/analyze.png?raw=true "analyze")

**- Step 3:** Query the result from the database.

**-Step 4:** Enjoy the result.

# How to query

**DEVLENS** provide a easy and nice way to query and check results directly through in your terminal.

## interactive mode
After the analyze, you can query your Annotations directly from you terminal :

![query](/../static/img/query/query.png?raw=true "query")


## classic mode

If you prefer to use the `Classic mode` (We won't be mad if you do :) ), you can execute directly the `query` command :

```bash
./devlens query "SELECT value from annotation Where name='Import'"
```
This command will result on a output directly on the terminal.

![classic](/../static/img/query/classic.png?raw=true "classic")
